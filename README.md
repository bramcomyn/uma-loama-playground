# UMA LOAMA Playground

This repository contains playground/pathfinding implementations of features I have to implement in the UMA or LOAMA repositories.
The code is fully functional, but has to be ported completely towards the respective technologies and existing implementations.
All code and features here are subject to changes and reviews, possibly without warnings.
